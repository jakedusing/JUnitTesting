# Utilities Class Testing

A repository showing tests cases implemented using JUnit.  The tests ensure that the utility methods function as expected under various conditions.

## Overview of Testing
Testing is done using two test classes:
<br>
-`UtilitiesTest`: Contains unit test for individual methods in the `Utilities` class.
<br>
-`UtilitiesTestParameterized`: Uses parameterized testing for the `removePairs` method.
